# European cities location quiz game


An easy HTML5/JS web geographical game using Google maps API. So occurs inside a world map provided by Google maps, with usual control, zooms in/out.


A score bar is shown at the beginning of the website, with the number of cities well-placed (marker should be at least on the range of 50 kilometres from the city) and the number of cities left to end a game (right now is configured for 9 cities). On the following line the number of remaining kilometres countdown is placed (start with 1500 kilometres). A “start game” button placed over the map will initiate the play. Then the requested city will be shown on the same place as the previous mentioned button.   

The game consists in place the marker over the map the nearer to the requested European down-town city. When the marker is located to the desired place, the user will press “check” button. Then the distance to the city is showed by a line and a circle range of 50 kilometres around it. A message will tell you the distance to the goal, and also the score will be updated in the top of the webpage.      

So the game continue until you finish with all the cities or running out your available kilometres. At the bottom of the webpage session hi-score and the 10th best results are shown.


Spanish version is also implemented and accessed by a top right corner link. On the Spanish version the game is more difficult, so no country borders are shown.
